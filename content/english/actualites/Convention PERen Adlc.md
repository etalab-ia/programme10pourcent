The French Competition Authority and PEReN have signed a convention outlining the conditions under which PEReN will provide technical assistance to the French Competition Authority in its missions. PEReN will be able to intervene on subjects related to data analysis, source code, computer programs, algorithmic processing, algorithm auditing and provide its technical expertise for controls, investigations or studies related to digital platforms. This assistance may also translate in the appointment of PEReN agents as “rapporteurs extérieurs”. This signature is a consequence of the decision of the public authorities to equip themselves with the technical means to effectively address the challenges of the digital economy.


The French Competition Authority has extensive experience in the digital field, particularly given its experience in the area of anti-competitive practices control. In September 2020, it decided to develop advanced expertise by creating the Digital Economy Department, with expert profiles in data science. Finally, the Authority has made digital one of its priorities for several years.


PEReN is an innovative pole, created by the [decree n°2020-1102 of the 31st August, 2020][1], and placed under the joint authority of **Bruno Le Maire**, the Minister of Economy and Finance, **Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin**, the Minister of Culture, and **Cédric O**, the Secretary of State for Digital Affairs. Its objective is to create a pole of expertise capable of assisting the various administrations and authorities involved in the regulation of digital platforms, by providing them technical assistance in the fields of data processing, data science and algorithmic processing.


With the signing of this agreement, work on the development and optimisation of tools to automatically retrieve online information in a standardised format will be intensified. This work will then benefit all state services involved in the regulation of digital platforms.
