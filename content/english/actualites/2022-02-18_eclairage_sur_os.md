title: "Shedding light on…n°2 // Mobile applications: what are the security issues for their distribution outside OS stores?"
date: 2022-02-18T18:00:00+02:00
summary: Until now, mobile applications have been distributed almost exclusively through the application stores of operating system developers, on their own terms. These terms are changing under pressure from publishers on the one hand, and with the help of ongoing national and international regulatory changes on the other. In the second issue of its “Shedding light on...” series, the PEReN takes a closer look at the technical and security issues related to this opening, particularly for the end users.

_Until now, mobile applications have been distributed almost exclusively through the application stores of operating system developers, on their own terms. These terms are changing under pressure from publishers on the one hand, and with the help of ongoing national and international regulatory changes on the other.

The democratization of smartphones has brought with it radical changes in the way we install our applications. From a decentralized and open model, with downloads from third-party sites on our computers, we have moved to a centralized and sometimes closed model on our smartphones. Now, installation of applications is often, and in some cases exclusively, done from the application store of the operating system developer.

This restricted distribution method is being challenged by several national and international regulations under development, including the Digital Market Act, which aims toopen up the distribution of applications to third-party sources. While often justified by economic stakes, such opening raises issues related to user security and in particular protection against malware.

What is malware, how does it spread, how to avoid it? How to protect users while offering them a wider selection of applications? In this second issue of “Shedding light on…” the PEReN offers some answers.
