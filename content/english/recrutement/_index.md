## How does the application process work?

### 1. Applying

<img style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;" src="undraw_job_offers_kw5d.svg" alt="Illustration for the section" title="Je postule">

To support the strong growth of the service, we regularly upload offers on this page. Interested in one of them? Do not hesitate any longer and apply on [Passerelles][1] or [Place de l'Emploi Public][2]. Internship offers are available on [PASS][3]. Please note that fluency in French is required for all positions.

As PEReN is looking for highly specialised profiles with strong hard skills, you may not meet all the required prerequisites of your dream job: do not let that stop you from applying!
Once your candidacy has been submitted, you will receive a confirmation e-mail and our team will review your application.

### 2. Application processing

<img style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;" src="undraw_Resume_re_hkth.svg" alt="Illustration for the section" title="Examen des candidatures">

We consider that if you have invested time and energy to apply for one of our positions, it is natural that we dedicate the same to properly review it. Your application will be processed by at least two members of PEReN team, depending of the requirements needed.

If you pass the screening, you will be contacted for an interview.



### 3. The interview

<img style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;" src="../equipe/undraw_interview_rmcf.svg" alt="Illustration for the section" title="Entretien">

The aim of the interview, which takes place with the PEReN members who have seen your application, is to build an exchange with you. This allows us to get to know you, to understand the motivations that led you to apply and to check that your technical skills effectively correspond to what we are looking for.

The interview is not a trap! Do not forget that the people you are exchanging with are the ones who singled out your application because they thought you had the right profile.

So the best advice we can give you is: be yourself!



### 4. When will I hear back from you?

<img style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;" src="undraw_Hiring_re_yk5n.svg" alt="Illustration for the section" title="Réponse définitive">

There might be a delay before you hear back from us, but this does not mean that we are not interested in your application. First, we always leave a long enough window after we open a new position so that interested talents have sufficient time to apply – so it is possible that you do not receive an answer immediately, even if you are the perfect candidate. Also, meticulously screening applications the way we do it is a lengthy process given the requirements we are looking for, especially as we receive a lot of applications. Be patient and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible!
